4NOTES::

 you must install opencv4 and opencv4-contrib from opencv website. Steps are on the website. 

 Go to CMakeLists.txt and edit your opencv path to include the directory of install.




 A NOTE ON DEPLOYMENT::
 if this is deployed / distributed, we need to include FFMPEG binary because it's the video i/o backend https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/da7/videoio_overview.html
